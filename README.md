# code-automator
Helps get the correct html code for common names of website page section


# How to use:
The application works with restrictions on how to ask question. 
- You make your request, starting with number and a single space between and the thing you need the application to give you html code for. e.g "4 links". 

- If you need code for more than one thing, you will seperate each one with a comma and immediately followed by the next thing e.g "5 links,6 logo,3 nav",etc.

Don't use quote around your request!!!


- Common response and their meaning:
** If you are told that "Specify the number you want", it means you did not tell how many of the code you want to generate for your request.

** If you are told that "Request not recognized", it means the application doesn't have the code for what you are currently asking, you might use a more familiar word or check your request for any error of either spaces or any special character

Note: Work is still ongoing to ensure all this modifications are considered.
